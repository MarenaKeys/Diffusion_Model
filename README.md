- show results e.g., (need to have a folder named Task 2 here.)




- show how to run the code




    e.g. ```python folder2/xx.py```






## Task 3: Pretrained Models ##

For the first notebook, I used images of cats to train the model and for the second model, I used images of yorkies. The resulting images of the first model were more realistic compared to the images produced in the second model.
