# Summer Research: Stable Diffusion Models 


## Task 1: Tutorial on Generative Modeling##

-  Task 1/Tutorial Video 



## Task 2: Pytorch Tutorial ##

The resulting path shows how to compute basic matrix operations using Pytorch <br/>
Results: Task 2/TensorMath.py <br/>

## Task 3: Pretrained Models ##

For the first notebook, I used images of cats to train the model and for the second model, I used images of yorkies. The resulting images of the first model were more realistic compared to the images produced in the second model.
